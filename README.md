# postgres---docker-


First get the git clone from my repo

this is the expliantion of the code 

        version: '3.8'
             This line specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format that the configuration adheres to. Docker
             Compose is a tool for defining and managing multi-container Docker applications using a configuration file called docker-compose.yml

        services:
             This section defines the services (containers) that will be created.

        db: 
            This is the name of the 'service', and it represents a 'PostgreSQL database container'.

        container_name: 
            postgresql: It assigns a custom name "postgresql" to the container. This name allows you to identify and access the container easily
        
        image: postgres:14:
             It specifies the Docker image to be used for the PostgreSQL database, which is the official PostgreSQL version 14 image. Docker will pull this image from the Docker Hub if it doesn't exist locally

        restart: always: 
            It configures the container to automatically restart if it stops or crashes, ensuring the database service is always running.


        environment:
             This section sets environment variables inside the container. In this case, it sets three environment variables required by PostgreSQL: POSTGRES_USER
             "postgres", and "mydatabase," respectively. These variables determine the initial configuration of the PostgreSQL database.

        volumes: 
            It creates a Docker volume named "mydata" and mounts it to the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory inside the container. This volume provides persistent storage for the PostgreSQL database files, ensuring that data is preserved even if the container is stopped or removed.

            volumes (outside the services section): This section defines the named volume "mydata" that can be used by other services or containers. It creates a named volume separate from the container, allowing data to be stored outside the container's lifecycle.


        Simple explaintion of Volume :
            In Docker, volumes are a way to store data that can be used by containers. They provide a method to keep data separate from the containers themselves. When you use a volume, the actual data is not stored directly on your computer's hard drive (host system). Instead, Docker manages the storage of volumes in a special location within Docker's file system.


            When you define a named volume in a Docker Compose file, like "mydata," you are creating a place to store data outside the container's life cycle. The data is managed by Docker, and it's like having a virtual hard drive accessible to the containers that use it.
